# Paul Kramme's Website

Welcome to Paul Kramme's website.

## About me
I am a 17 years old programmer from Hanover, who loves program, apparently.
I upload my source code to [GitHub](https://github.com/paulkramme) and like
to try out as much technologies as possible, such as different programming languages,
techniques, applications, hardware, and much more. My love for computer related topics already
showed in my early childhood, where I continuously searched for spare computers, which
I could use. Today, this hasn't change, except my love for computers now took over on servers,
which I can use and modify to test my own code on it, and expand my knowledge on UNIX like OSs,
such as FreeBSD and Linux. I am also providing small services for friends, like game- and TeamSpeak
servers.

## My projects
My first major project has been the RoverPi project, in which it was the task to create
software for a self build rover, so it can be driven around. Although due to changed project requirements not
being used, it was a success, because it told me much about the C programming language,
as well as best development practices, Git, the Raspberry Pi, GPIOs, and much more.

My second large project took a lot more planning, as was an idea in my head since 2012: A modular backup
program, which would make offsite backups easy, and as there is no real open source alternative, which
fits my needs, I decided to build one myself. This project is currently work in progress. The first prototype is already released,
and currently the program is rewritten into a server.

Between and beside this large projects, I managed to build some little things, mostly to test
out new things, so they could be integrated into the large ones. For a complete list, check out my GitHub profile.

## My servers
Currently, I have two important servers, a NAS and my main application servers. Both are running FreeBSD.

## Yuck, why does this website look like *this*?!
Seriously, I neither have time nor capacity to download 2MB per site I visit. This website transfers text,
and nothing more, and it does not need to do more. It is sufficient. It is easy to edit.
Why would I want to trade this for a not necessarily better looking site, which takes ages to load,
is difficult to write and edit and looks different in every browser? This even runs in IE! [Here](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com)
is a good explanation of what I mean (probably NSFW (swearing... yeah...)).
